# Mnemonic:	bootstrap_build -- allow us to build on a non-cluster node
# Abstract:	This should set things up enough on a new node to build our source
#		This is a chicken and egg script. You must have it to start, but 
#		once you have it it will check out the sourece from cvs and get you
#		started. Run with 'ksh bootstrap_build.ksh'  and when it is done 
#		it will print the steps needed to build on a virgin node.  If you 
#		need to see the steps again, run with -h or -? options.
# options:	
#		-a		-- do everything (including make)
#		-c host		-- host where cvs repository lives (if fetching)
#		-d directory	-- the directory  in cvs tree (if fetching source)
#		-D directory	-- the directory that the source is in ($TMP/$USER/dev)
#		-h		-- show help info
#		-i directory    -- install only; pkg files in current directory are installed into dir listed
#		-k		-- keep tmp files and such after build
#		-n		-- do not fetch source from cvs (fetch if script thinks necessary)
#		-N		-- nuke first
#		-p		-- generate packages (implies -a)
#		-R directory	-- directory to use as temporary NG_ROOT
#		-t direcotry	-- Directory to use as $TMP

# Mod:		16 Jan 2006 (sd) : Added setup_common call
#		30 May 2006 (sd) : Added /usr/common/ast/bin to end of path.  Needed for 
#			ksh on a virgin node now that we reference NG_ROOT/common/bin for 
#			things. 
#		26 Nov 2007 (sd) : Added ability to create a mk Makefile helper file if it does 
#			not exist.

==========================================================================
Ningaui source should be set up in $d 
$r should have been created as a temporary NG_ROOT directory. 
The source can now be compiled.

You may execute ng_build.ksh -a [-p] to build and optionally
generate package files, or you may manually go through the 
steps to build:
	1) source in the file: $TMP/build_setup.$USER

	2) cd $d/ningaui/contrib

	3) execute these commands to build mk: 
		ksh build precompile; 
		ksh build all; 
		ksh build install 

	4) cd $d/ningaui

	5) execute these commands to build: 
		mk precompile; 	
		mk all; 
		mk Install
	
	6) add $r to your PATH

	7) execute these to build man pages (in ./manuals)
	   and to create index.html:
		mk manpages

	8) generate packages with these commands:
		ng_sm_mkpkg contrib
		ng_sm_mkpkg potoroo

After packages are built, you can manually install them by uncompressing
and passing the data to tar, or you can execute:
        ksh ng_build.ksh -v -i ${NG_ROOT:-NG_ROOT}

which will install the packages into the ${NG_ROOT:-NG_ROOT} directory. 

NOTE: On the mk Install command the 'I' is capitalised as this install
	will place ningaui into the bld_root directory in the current 
	directory, in preparation to generate packages, and does NOT do 
	an install on the node.

		-c host supply cvs host name	(value of NG_CVSHOST)
		-d dir	cvs root directory on -c host (/cvsroot)
		-D dir  dir where ningaui src tree is, or will be after fetch (see note)
		-f	force source fetch (fetch done only if script thinks it is needed)
		-i dir  Install pacakges from this directory into dir and exit (all other actions/options ignored)
		-k 	keep temp files	(temp files are removed)
		-r dir	directory used as NG_ROOT during the build (see note)

		-t dir	directory used as working space (/ningaui/tmp if present, otherwise /tmp)
		-v	verbose mode on
		
	For most, executing this script with the -a and -p options should be all that is needed 
	to build ningaui and create two package files (one for contrib and one for potoroo). The
	package files can then be 'installed' on like nodes in the cluster. 

	By default an attempt to fetch source is made only if the script believes
	that the source is not already available. Supplying the -c or -f options force 
	an attempt to fetch the source. To fetch source, it is assumed that the -c option 
	was used to supply the name of the machine that houses the CVS repository containing
	Ningaui source; the -d option needs to be used if the root of CVS repository is 
	not /cvsroot.  

	When not fetching the source from a CVS repository, the script assumes that the current 
	working directory ends with the final directory name of ningaui (e.g. /tmp/scooter/build/ningaui) 	
	and that all of the ningaui source exists in subdirectories to the current. Please see 
	one of the README files for more details on files, directories that are created and/or used during 
	the build processes, in addition to a broader discussion on how to build ningaui.

	TROUBLESHOOTING
	If this script dies with a shell error (probably something like 'bad substitution'), then the 
	version of Kshell that was used to execute the script is not recent enough.  Get the most recent
	Kshell version, or use the full path of the most recent version when invoking this script. At 
	the time of this writing, bash is not capable of executing this script because of its limitations.

&break	[-h] [-k] [-R root-dir] [-t tmp-dir] [-v]
&space
	ng_build.ksh [-v] -i ng-root-directory

&space
&desc	&This script creates a build environment in which ningaui software
	can be compiled.  If the source is not already in the current working 
	directory, and the CVS host with the source is available, the source is
	fetched.  If the all (-a) option is supplied on the command line, &this
	will attempt to compile all of the source. 
&space
	In general, &this is used to compile ningaui source and place it into 
	a 'build root' directory structure from which ningaui packages can be
	created.  It is possible to supply a real 'root' directory on the 	
	command line (-R) which will cause the newly built software to be installed
	into the named directory, rather than it being placed into a subdirectory
	to the current working directory.

&space
	&This will attempt to fetch the ningaui source from the CVS host if 
	it believes the source does not already exist in the current directory
	tree. The force (-f) option can be used to force a fetch. If the CVS 
	host that holds the ningaui source is not available using the -f option 
	will cause the script to fail.

&space
	At a minimum, this script sets up the following directories in the current
	working directory:
&space
&begterms
&term	.bin : A small set of tools and scripts that are needed by the build 
	process.
&space
&term	bld_root : A directory used as NG_ROOT (PKG_ROOT) during the build process. 
	The installation step of the build will install scripts, binaries and 
	other files into the directories under this directory.  The -R option 
	causes the script to use an alternate 'root' directory allowing the 
	newly built software to be directly installed. 
&space
&term	include : Ningaui header files are placed here.
&space
&term	stlib : Ningaui library files are placed here. 
&space
&term	manuals : HTML man pages are placed here when `mk manpages` is executed. 
&endterms
&space
	&This also creates an environment setup script fragment file in 
	build_setup.$USER in the $TMP directory (see -t).  This file should
	be sourced into the environment before running any &lit(mk) commands.
	If &this is used to compile the source after establishing the 
	environment, it is not necessary to source the file.  
&space
&subcat Building Packages
	After the software is built, even if not installed outside of the build 
	environment, it is possible to create ningaui packages. To do this
	the environmental setup file &stress(MUST) be sourced in, and then 
	the &lit(ng_sm_mkpkg) command can be executed.  The &lit(ng_sm_mkpkg)
	command will create packages for the components named on the command 
	line which can be sent and installed on other ningaui hosts. 


&opts	The following command line options are available:
&begterms
&term	-a : Build all. In addition to creating the environment the 	
	script will build the software. If this option is not supplied, 
	the build environment is intialised and the user must follow
	the instructions written to the standard error device to 
	compile the software. 
&space
&term	-c host : Supplied the name of the CVS host to fetch a copy 
	of the software from.   This option implies &lit(-f) and will 
	force a fetch of the source even if it exists in the current 
	directory.
&space
&term	-D dir : Causes the script to use &ital(dir) as the build directory.
	When omitted from the command line, the current directory is used. 
&space
&term	-d dir : Supplies the directory within the CVS environment (cvs root)
	to use when fetching source.  If not supplied, /cvsroot is assumed.
&space
&term	-f : Force a source fetch from CVS.  This script only fetches the source
	if the source appears not to reside in the current working directory (or 
	the directory supplied with the -D option). 
&space
&term	-h : Displays a short help message, and build instuctions if the environment
	has already been setup by this script. 
&space
&term	-i dir : Assumes package files (pkg-*) exist in the current directory. These 
	packages are installed into the &ital(dir) named after the option.  If this 
	option is used, all other options and actions are ignored. 
&space
&term	-k : Keep temporary files. 
&space
&term	-R dir : Supplies the directory used as NG_ROOT during the build process.
	If not supplied the directory &lit(bld_root) is created in the build 
	directory.  It is necessary to supply this directory only if the software
	is to be installed directly (say into /usr/local/ningaui) rather than 
	build with the intension of creating packages. 
&space
&term	-s path : Supplies the full path of the Korn shell (including the /ksh). This 
	string is used in all #! lines when .ksh script are installed.  If this is 
	not supplied, a search for kshell is made and the first one found is used. 
	The search order is: 
&space
&beglist
&item	/usr/common/ast/bin
&item	/usr/local/bin
&item	/usr/bin
&item	/bin
&endlist
&space
&term	-t dir : Uses &ital(dir) as a temporary directory.  If not supplied 
	&this will use &lit(/ningaui/tmp) or &lit(/tmp) if &lit(/ningaui/tmp) 
	does not exist. 
&space
&term	-v : Verbose mode.  
&endterms
